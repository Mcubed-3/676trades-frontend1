      <p>
        These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your use of the 676Trades website, dashboard, and related services
        (the “Service”) operated by <b>676Trades</b> (“we”, “us”, “our”).
        By creating an account or using the Service, you agree to these Terms.
      </p>

      <h2>1) Important risk notice (read this)</h2>
      <p>
        Trading involves risk. You can lose some or all of the money you deposit with your broker.
        The Service does <b>not</b> guarantee profits, performance, or results. Past performance is not indicative of future results.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Not financial advice:</b> The Service is provided for informational/automation tooling purposes only.
        We are not providing investment, legal, or tax advice. You are responsible for your decisions and outcomes.

      <h2>2) Eligibility</h2>
      <p>
        You must be legally allowed to use this Service in your location and to open/operate a trading account with your broker.
        You are responsible for ensuring compliance with your local laws and broker rules.

      <h2>3) Accounts and security</h2>

        <li>You are responsible for all activity that occurs under your account.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4) How the Service works (summary)</h2>
      <p>
        The Service provides a dashboard that can control settings for a MetaTrader 5 Expert Advisor (“EA”) via an API key.
        Your EA may poll our backend for configuration and may send heartbeat/status information.
      </p>

      <h2>5) Subscriptions, trials, billing</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>If you choose a free trial, it will last the number of days shown at checkout (for example, 5 days).</li>
        <li>After a trial ends, you may be charged according to the plan you selected unless you cancel before renewal.</li>
        <li>Billing is handled by a third-party payment processor (e.g., Stripe). You agree to their terms as well.</li>
        <li>If payment is required and your subscription is not active, we may disable trading controls until payment resumes.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Refunds</h3>
      <p>
        Unless required by law, subscription fees are generally non-refundable once a billing period has started.
